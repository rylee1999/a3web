				<h3>Consulting</h3>
				<p>
					<!--ChatGPT SupplementaryItems\ChatGPT.txt
					<!--ChatGPT 3.5 Prompt: Can you please write a paragraph about consulting? But at the same time pretend you don't actually know what consulting is-->
					Consulting is a fascinating field that seems to involve individuals providing some sort of expertise or advice to others. It's like a mysterious world where people with knowledge in various areas come together to share their insights and help others navigate complex challenges. There's a sense that consultants possess a special kind of wisdom, almost like modern-day wizards who offer strategic spells to businesses or individuals seeking direction. It's intriguing how these consultants, armed with their intellectual prowess, swoop in to analyze problems and conjure up solutions. The term "consulting" itself sounds so professional and enigmatic, leaving one to wonder what magical processes might be at play behind closed boardroom doors. It's as if they hold the keys to unlocking the secrets of success, making consulting a captivating enigma in the business realm. As a consulting firm we offer lots of consulting. Consulting is so good. We're really good at it too! We can help you guys with consulting.
				</p>
				<h3>Ecosystem Management</h3>
				<p>
					We're really not sure what Ecosystem Management is but we offer that. This includes looking at benthics, identifying plants, and public speaking.
				</p>
				<h3>Conservation Biology</h3>
				<p>
					Very similiar to Ecosystem Management! This will cost you more but it makes sense because there is lab equipment involved with this service.
				</p>
				<h3>Forestry</h3>
				<p>
					We think that our forestry services include looking at trees, safely using chainsaws, and lot's of Forest Resources Inventory. Overall seems like a good service.
				</p>
				<h3>GIS for Analytics</h3>
				<p>
					Have you ever heard of Google Maps? Geographic information Systems (GIS) is similiar. GIS is a tool that that helps you analyze data on a map. We offer great GIS services, such as making colourful maps, managing databases, remote sensing crops, and even building a website.
